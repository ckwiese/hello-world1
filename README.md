# hello-world1

Hello,

Slowly but surely learning Web Development and SQL.  I would enjoy learning the mastery of Web Dev. and 
all the javascript that goes along with it.  This is my first "repository??".  Started Github today on 3-22-2018. 
Soon I will upload my wordpress and html sites.  

That is all.

Chris
